# QFR3DReconstructionAPP

This repo is used as a record of developing a QFR3DReconstructionAPP at Escope Tech from May 2019 to Aug 2019

Contributions:
 - Modified the binocular stereo vision method to detect the severity of vascular stenosis using DSA images in Python and C++
 - Reconstructed central lines for blood vessels using image preprocessing and epipolar constraint principal
 - Acquired 3D cloud point of vessel surface using Pinhole model and Newton-Raphson method

Techniques:
   - Algorithms/Models: Epipolar Constraint, Pinhole Model, Newton-Raphson Method
   - Frameworks/Libraries: OpenCV, Qt, Spyder, ParaView
   - Languages: C++, python

The code and note(in Chinese) are finished on 7/29/2019 which is not the final version of this private project. But you are welcome to contact me and ask any questions about this project.
